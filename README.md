# CUUBA
Project Developed from Oct 2020 - Jan 2021.

This Arduino-powered robot cleaner serves to automate the task of vacuuming floors! 

It features a 3D printed chassis along with a turbine pulled from a broken vacuum cleaner. It also features a removable waste housing along with environment detection using ultrasonic sensors.
Through its Arduino Nano computer and modular chassis design, the CUUBA can be fitted with additional tools to perform extra tasks. Maintenance is also easier due to the design.
